Website for Communications Lab Class - Fall 2022 NYUAD
•	Project Name:
Website name: Stars Up. 
Name of the video: Look Up from Your Phone. 

•	Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

 This MFF 60 film looks into how the NYUAD community as a whole deals with its members' incessant need to be connected via mobile devices and online spaces. On campus, it's easy to spot a common trend of people solely looking at their phones as they walk around. Friends in the NYUAD community who shunned interactions in settings like the dining hall (D2), The Palms, or even on the way to class served as the inspiration for the project. Even when other friends are present in the same environment, students have abused the use of mobile phones and social media. A collective behavior known as the conundrum cannot be attributed to a single individual. 

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

Luke, Dhabia, and I set out to various locations on campus to record how often this behavior occurs. The locations included Market Place, D2, Library Café and the Palms. After combining the videos, editing them in IMovie, and adding a voiceover, I created the website which houses the video. 


•	Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

Looking back at my initial 30MFF Wire Frame, the gist of the website matches exactly what I had envisioned. If anything, I just added more elements and text when you scroll down through the website. I wanted the video to be at the center of the screen of the website so the user clicks on it first, before exploring the rest of the website. The process of creating the website though, took a lot of trial and error. I have worked with HTML before which is why I didn’t struggle in creating the website layout. However; working with CSS and Java was new to me so I had to use resources like YouTube tutorials and the UNIX Lab which were extremely helpful in bringing the interactive elements of the website to life. Overall, I am happy with how the website turned out and with the collaborative effort of Dhabia, Luke and I.
